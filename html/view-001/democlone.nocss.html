<h3>Sample Backend List (products)</h3>
<p>This HTML is processed from a file found at <a href="/html/view-001/democlone.nocss.html" target="_blank">/html/view-001/democlone.nocss.html</a>. Then the cloned cells are rendered from a backend JSON request from <a href="https://dummyjson.com/products" target="_blank">https://dummyjson.com/products</a>.</p>
<p>The following data is from JSON. It has been preloaded, reformatted and renamed to products for proper framework consumption.</p>
<div class="clone" data-data-source="products">
    <span>
        <span>{{aug:index}}: {{rec:title}} ({{rec:brand}})</span> &nbsp;
    </span>
</div>
