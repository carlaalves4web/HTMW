<h3>Sample Backend List (products)</h3>
<p>This HTML is processed from a file found at <a href="/html/view-001/democlone.html" target="_blank">/html/view-001/democlone.html</a>. Then the cloned cells are rendered from a backend JSON request from <a href="https://dummyjson.com/products" target="_blank">https://dummyjson.com/products</a>.</p>
<p>The following data is from JSON. It has been preloaded, reformatted and renamed to <span class="fst-italic">products</span> for proper framework consumption.</p>
<div class="row clone" data-data-source="products">
    <div class="col-3">{{aug:index}}: {{rec:title}} ({{rec:brand}})</div>
</div>
