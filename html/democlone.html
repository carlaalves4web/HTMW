<h3>Sample Backend List (products)</h3>
<p>This HTML is processed from a file found at /html/democlone.html. Then the cloned cells are rendered from a "dynamic" backend JSON request from https://dummyjson.com/products.</p>
<p>The JSON was preloaded, formatted and renamed to 'products' for proper framework consumption.</p>
<div class="row clone" data-data-source="products">
    <div class="col-3">{{rec:title}} ({{rec:brand}})</div>
</div>
